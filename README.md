# the-deep
Android game developed using Unity

A deep-sea action-packed android shooter game whose main objective is to protect a lone
diver from different monsters coming to devour him. The character protects himself by
moving around a predefined environment while simultaneously shooting projectiles
towards these hungry deep-sea beasts. This application is a multi-level progression game
which creates monsters at random and challenges the player to survive the incoming
wave of enemies for as long as possible. Once a predetermined number of monsters are
destroyed the player will proceed to the next level which has a higher number of enemies
who are not only faster, but also have increased difficulty.

The player will have a full 360-degree range of motion and will be able to acquire power-
ups throughout the course of the game which will give him an upper hand over the beasts
that are encountered. Each player will be granted a health bar which steadily declines
every time he is touched by one of the incoming enemies. Once the characterâ€™s health bar
reaches zero the game will be over.
